# Phase 1 Project - Digital NotePad
This project is a simple note-taking app that lets users add, view, and delete notes, storing them with json-server. It supports keyboard shortcuts and dynamic UI updates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Add Notes** – Users can enter a topic and content for a note, which is then saved to a database (json-server).

- **View Notes** – All saved notes are displayed in a card-like format on the UI.

- **Delete Notes** – Users can remove notes, and they will be deleted from both the UI and the database.

- **View Note Details** – Clicking a "View Me" button displays the full content of a note in a separate area.

- **Keyboard Support** – Pressing the "Enter" key submits a new note..
